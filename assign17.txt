Constraining the Values of your data.*/
/*1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as
 all combinations of cnum and snum are
 different from one another, and
 so that NULL values are excluded from the date field.*/
 
 CREATE TABLE orders1 ( 
 onum int(4), cnum int(4), sname varchar(10), odate date NOT NULL, 
 CONSTRAINT PRIMARY key(onum,cnum,sname) );

/*2) Create the Salespeople table 
so that the default commission is 10% with
 no NULLS permitted, snum is the primary key, 
 and all names fall alphabetically 
 between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).*/
 CREATE TABLE salespeople1 ( 
 comm float(4) DEFAULT 10 not null, 
 snum int(4) PRIMARY KEY,

/*3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum 
is greater than the cnum, and the cnum is greater that 
the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields.*/
